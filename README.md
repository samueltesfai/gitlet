# Gitlet
A project based off of UC Berkeley's 61B course. A version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git, namely its local features. Ours is smaller and simpler, however, so we have named it Gitlet.

The commands implemented are ```init```, ```add```, ```commit```, ```rm```, ```log```, ```global-log```, ```find```, ```status```, ```checkout```, ```branch```, ```rm-branch```, ```reset```, and ```merge```.
